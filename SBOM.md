## Packaging and Distribution

- This library is not distributed as part of any hardware or software product.
- It is not installed or deployed on customer systems or embedded devices.
- It is intended to be used only internally as a tool to support development and testing of embedded hardware, firmware and software products, but **not as a part of or a fully commercial product**.

---

## Security Considerations

- The software does **not implement or rely on encryption** or cryptographic protocols.
- It does **not interface with cloud services**, remote systems, or external APIs.
- All data flow occurs locally via LAN or USB to AWGs using the VXI-11 protocol.
- No persistent storage or telemetry is performed.

## CRA Relevance

Based on its purpose, scope, and deployment context, `pyawg` is not considered a "product with digital elements" as defined by the **EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)**. As such, the obligations outlined in the CRA are not applicable to this project.

This SBOM is provided for transparency and traceability in alignment with secure software development practices.
